Gesture-based-painting-and-video-recording with Zoom-in and Zoom-out features.
==========================================

Gesture based painting and video recording being inspired by Pranav Mistry's work, SixthSense.

A C plus-plus project developed using Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. It runs perfectly fine on Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 version. However, with a few or no changes, should work with the higher versions as well.

Flow of the project:
Painting and video recording with Zoom-in and Zoom-out features are the two operations that could be carried out.

Use an orange ball to place the cursor on different options and hover it for around 10 seconds to select a particular feature.

The selection of the leftmost option would facilitate painting. Use two orange balls. With one ball held at a fixed point (which is similar to clicking a mouse), move the other orange ball to draw an object of desired shape. Use a blue colored object to quit this feature (hold it for ten seconds). The ball held at a fixed position can be used to change the co-ordinates.

The middle option would record a video. Again use two orange balls, to zoom in and zoom out. The distance between the balls would be a measure of the zoom feature.

The rightmost option will quit the project.
